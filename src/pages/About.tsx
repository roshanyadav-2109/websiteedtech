                <p>
                  Unknown IITians was born from the shared vision of two entrepreneurial-minded friends who met in the heart of India's coaching hub—a city where thousands of students chase dreams of cracking competitive exams like JEE and NEET. Amid the relentless pressure and the rigid paths carved out by the system, these two visionaries saw a different possibility: a world where education wasn't just about securing a rank but about true learning, exploration, and carving one's unique journey.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  What started as a simple YouTube channel to guide students through the IIT Madras BS Degree program soon transformed into something much bigger. The duo realized that countless students were struggling—not just with academics, but with a deeper issue: the lack of direction beyond traditional career options. Inspired by their own experiences, they set out to create a platform that wouldn't just help students crack exams but would also empower them to discover careers aligned with their passions.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Unknown IITians rapidly expanded its mission, offering high-quality, free resources for JEE, NEET, and other competitive exams. However, the platform stands apart because it doesn't just push students toward the conventional rat race of engineering and medical fields. Instead, it actively promotes alternative career paths, skill-based learning, and entrepreneurial thinking—so students can make informed choices rather than just follow the crowd.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Beyond academic support, Unknown IITians provides mentorship programs, real-world skill development, and a thriving community of learners and industry professionals. The goal is simple yet revolutionary: to ensure that students who are genuinely interested in fields like engineering and medicine don't fall behind due to a lack of resources, while also guiding others toward non-traditional careers where they can thrive.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  With bigger plans on the horizon, Unknown IITians is on a mission to redefine success in education—one student at a time. The journey has only begun, and the future holds limitless possibilities.
